When I was in the EBL Department, the other specialists and I spent months working on a middle school schedule to prepare for the reconfiguration when 6th grade would move into the middle school and 9th grade would move into the high school. Leslie Allen and I worked hard with School Performance Director Mike Sirois to create a schedule that would allow built-in time for students to have remediation and enrichment in ELA and Math courses. 

As you can see under the heading of "Students Achieve Under New Middle School Schedule" in [these board meeting minutes](http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=2744%3Aboard-meeting-tuesday-feb-4-2014&Itemid=630&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BoardMeetingSummary+%28Board+Meeting+Summaries%29), "Middle school reading scores have skyrocketed this fall, following an emphasis on reading and interdisciplinary teaming in the [new middle school model](http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=1687&Itemid=804)". 

It is really awesome to see the model that I had a hand in creating come to fruition AND see that model produce great results for the students in our district. I certainly wasn't the only one working on it, but I remember "building the board" in bed late into the night with fake teachers; what an awesome learning experience for me.

This experience also represents a time when I was intensely focused on building and implementing a big vision that would affect hundreds of students. 

Leslie, Mike, and I had all worked to create this sort of schedule when Leslie and I were teachers for Mike at Fort Herriman Middle School. I am humbled that the work we started as enthusiastic teachers is now a model that all middle schools in our district embrace and that "the model is garnering attention statewide."

I really love the idea that in education, we can make innovative strides that lead to success for our students. 

Have a Good Life.
