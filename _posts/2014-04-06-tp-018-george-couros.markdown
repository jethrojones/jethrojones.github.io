I had the great pleasure to attend (and [present](http://jethrojones.com/ucet2014)) the UCET (Utah Coalition for Educational Technology) Conference this last Thursday and Friday. While it was a lot of fun, it was also ver powerful and transformative for me. I solidified some educational philosophies and had some time to actually think about what I am doing every day and how I am inspiring (or not) my teachers. George's keynote was very inspiring, but it was also practical, and I love practical presentations. I loved meeting George after following him for so long. This was a great interview.   

One thing that was really awesome was that he made me wait a few extra minutes to ensure that he had gone through and read every single tweet about his keynote, and replied to those that he felt needed a response. it was amazing to hear him say three or four times, "Just a minute, I need to get through all these tweets. There were a ton of tweets!"Â 


* His keynote called "Innovate! Create! Voice!" and what he was trying to communicate with that. 
* The importance of creating and sharing with others. 
* How he encourages teachers and principals to create and share. 
* What the [remix culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture) is about. 
* Why it is important to focus on what is really helping kids. 
* What it means to be a school teacher. 
* If you don't know what a hashtag and twitter are, you are illiterate. Why does George believe this? 
* How you can leverage your network to make things happen. 
* Why Twitter is about learning and sharing.
* How do we do things when our leaders aren't on board, yet?
* We need people who are willing to push. 
* The one thing you can do to be a transformative principal.
