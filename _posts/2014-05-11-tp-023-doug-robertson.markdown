He is the author of ["He's the Weird Teacher" (paperback)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492193836/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1492193836&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20&linkId=G5RSM36KBZ6I2BLB) [(Kindle edition)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EP354C2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EP354C2&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20&linkId=MEY3DCGECMYHD5AD).


I interviewed Doug because I read his book and was really fascinated by it. I have learned that not everyone teaches the same way (DUH!). But, also, our own life experiences have taught us and shaped us into the people we are today. To be a great teacher, you don't need to be like [Enter Great Teacher's Name]. Doug and every excellent "popular" or famous or movie teacher have two things in common:

1. A strong desire to be your own person, regardless of the status quo or anybody else's judgments. 
2. A passion to help kids learn. 

As part of this podcast, I want to start interviewing master teachers who are really great at what they do. I am especially interested in teachers that are great at making their kids enjoy class and learn life lessons, not just making sure they are acing the tests. ;)

Notes from my conversation with Doug:

* He used to teach in Hawaii, so we talked a little about that before the official interview started, but it was fascinating, so I included it. 
* Teaching is a performance art
* Acting vs. Teaching. 
* Importance of trust in teaching. 
* What happens in my classroom happens because I want it to. 
* To Principals: You hired me to do my job, now let me do it. 
* [Chris Hardwick](http://www.nerdist.com/author/chris-hardwick/)
* How he takes away the opportunity to make excuses.
* How swimming helped him learn to stop making excuses. 
* Why you can't keep complaining without doing something to fix it. 
* It is OK to vent about kids. "But, my kids don't give me much to complain about." (That is because if they did, he would take responsibility for it!)
* "My classroom is noisy because it has to be noisy."
* "My students are weird, what am I doing to make them weird."
* I give two cents on why I like a noisy cafeteria. 
* Some discussion on the term "digital native".
* We should call what we do "Practicing Education" just like lawyers practice law and doctors practice medicine. 
* How being a good teacher and establishing the basics allows us to know how we can change things up as we go along. 
* What kind of an environment does Doug need to thrive? Trust! 
* How trusting students is an extension of the trust from administration. 
* [Teach Like Your Hair is on Fire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OZ0NRG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OZ0NRG&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20&linkId=K4U6HTFDLGX5XSO4) by Rafe Esquith
* How to have your own style. Don't teach like someone else. Teach like yourself. 
* Some kids don't respond well to the style of Doug's teaching.
