#Transformative Principal Podcast

I started a podcast. In it, I interview transformative principals that are making a real difference in their students' lives. 

In the first episode, I start by explaining how my school increased attendance to 96% average. The audio is from a TEDx talk. 

Listen to it [here](http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/transformative-principal-000). I hope you enjoy it.
