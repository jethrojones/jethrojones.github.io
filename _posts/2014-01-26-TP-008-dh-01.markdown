In this episode, I am priveleged to interview Doug Hallenbeck. Doug was recently named the [Assistant Principal of the year from the Utah Association of Secondary School Principals](http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?Itemid=1&id=2699%3Aunion-assistant-principal-named-utahs-best&option=com_k2&view=item). Doug has worked under four really great principals and he shares some great insight about how to be an amazing assistant principal.

I wanted to interview Doug because he has a great story. He is a thoughtful, caring, and transformative leader. He has been a guiding force in our district since its inception. We are very fortunate to work with him. 

In this first part of the interview, Doug discusses:

* How he got to where he is.
* How he manages working under someone who has a different leadership style and may make different decisions than he. 
* The mentors that have helped him become a better leader. 
* Why he turned down a principalship and stayed as an assistant. 
* Advice for new principals from his perspective as an Assistant Principal.

You'll really enjoy this interview with Doug. He is amazing. 

Let's make sure to give him a few hundred more followers on Twitter. He is [@Hallen100](https://twitter.com/dhallen100).
