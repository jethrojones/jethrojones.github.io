I have always wanted a sweet dual-monitor setup, and I finally found a good deal on two monitors. And, since the wife and I just finished paying off all our student loan debt, I was stoked to be able to have some cash to pay for it.

Two ASUS 23" monitors, side by side. They both have HDMI, so they are current monitors. I bought a new monitor years ago, probably a decade ago, and I have used that monitor (and other cheaper, used monitors) for a long time. 

This new setup will not make me more productive, or better at anything I do. But, I will enjoy it a lot more! 

Have a Good Life.
