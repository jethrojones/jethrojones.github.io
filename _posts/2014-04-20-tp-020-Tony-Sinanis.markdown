* How to make sure the brand experience matches the brand promise. For example, here is an exchange between Tony and someone who knows what his school's brand promise is:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TonySinanis">@TonySinanis</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mrkempnz">@mrkempnz</a> I know you do!! :) All groups are equally respected and treated at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cantiague&amp;src=hash">#Cantiague</a>.</p>&mdash; Lisa (@lisaodavis) <a href="https://twitter.com/lisaodavis/statuses/456785463249235969">April 17, 2014</a></blockquote>

* Transparency has changed the relationship between the school and community. 
* PTA meetings have taken a new direction since they are so open. 
* Build it from the inside. 
* Faculty Enhancement opportunities instead of faculty meetings
* How to be a transformative principal like Tony. 
	1. It's not about you!
	2. Stay current on research. 
	3. Don't take yourself too seriously, but take the work you do seriously. 
* What he has in his office to keep him focused on how to be the best principal he can be.
