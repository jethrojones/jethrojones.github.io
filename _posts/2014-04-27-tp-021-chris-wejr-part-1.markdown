I was super excited to interview Chris Wejr. He is one of those principals that I have been following for a long time and his take on discipline and behavior is inspiring. 

* Moving from a lower SES school to a higher SES school. 
* If kids are driven by rewards, then they are across all areas. 
* It is very easy to go too far with rewards, and focus only on providing rewards for kids to "get us through the day."
* The problem with determining how to properly implement PBIS. 
* The complexities of correcting a student's behavior by giving them a reward when they behave correctly. 
* How important it is to have sense of belonging to help students avoid negative behaviors. 
* Strategies to help students who struggle with negative behavior overcome those struggles. 
* It sometimes takes 2 years to get kids to overcome their struggles. 
* How to buy yourself some time to make decisions and help get through the day to make sure you help kids who are struggling. 
* The bouncy ball trick that worked for me every time after I interviewed him. 
* The difference between a program and a system. 

This is a great interview. Chris is amazing!
