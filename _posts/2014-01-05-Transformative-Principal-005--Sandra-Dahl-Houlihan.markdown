Sandra is a great principal at Sandy Elementary. She has received numerous awards in her 7 years as an administrator: 

-Community Leader of the Year
-Rookie of the Year
-Distinguished Principal of the Year
-CITES Recognition
-National Board Certified Teacher

And, she is pretty much always being praised and recognized by her peers. I am fortunate to be able to work with her. 

[Here is Sandy's web site](http://sandy.canyonsdistrict.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SandyElementary).

Big Goals:
Wants to make people feel like they are at home-that her school is a family. 
Wants to be with the children as much as possible. 
Wants to provide a holistic education, especially to her disadvantaged students.

It is interesting to hear that she strives to really know her students, but is ok with not knowing every student's name. I find this fascinating. In the last episode, Dr. Villar was very focused on knowing every student's name. I don't know that either way is the best method, but I do believe that their intent is the same. They both want their students to know that they are cared for and feel safe. That is what matters.

What is in her office?

What can you do to be a transformative principal?
