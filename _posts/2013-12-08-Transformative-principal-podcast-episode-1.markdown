[This interview](http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/interview-with-sondra-jolovich-motes) with Sandra Jolovich-Motes (JM) is really fantastic.  This is part one of [two](http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/transformative-principal-002-interview-with-sondra-jolovich-motes-part-2). 

JM is making huge gains in her standardized test scores by focusing on data. She is an advocate of [Paul Bambrick-Santoya's](http://twitter.com/#!/Paul_bambrick) approach and recommends all principals take advantage of his books and resources. 

Have a good life.
