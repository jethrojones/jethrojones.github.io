One of my favorite things to make is almond butter. I don't really care for almond butter, in general, but when I make it at home, with fresh roasted almonds, it is quite delicious. 

1. Fill a cookie sheet with almonds. 
2. Sprinkle a teaspoon of (Splenda, cane sugar, Stevia, or whatever) and a teaspoon of cinnamon over the top.
3. Bake in an oven set at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 25-30 minutes. 
4. Place about a cup at a time of roasted almonds into your intense blender. I use a [Blendtec](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIGZXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000GIGZXM&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20). And the [Twister Jar](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087Q1T1S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0087Q1T1S&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20) is quite nice for this purpose. 
5. Add 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil (try different types of oil for different flavors, surprisingly, sesame is quite good). 
6. One my blender, I blend for about 40 seconds on speed setting 7. 

I've tried quite a few varieties over the years, adding in cocoa, bananas (though they make it quite hard), strawberries, jam, and other ingredients to make it fun. 

My favorite way to eat almond butter is by dipping apples in it.
