Little did I know, that he would be named the [New York Elementary Principal of the Year](http://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/jericho-educator-tony-sinanis-named-state-elementary-school-principal-of-the-year-1.7455369)! So, I interviewed him before he was famous. Tony [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tonysinanis) is a great principal and one who is eager to share what he is doing well. He is also incredibly humble and self-aware. I hope you enjoy his interview. I sure learned a lot from him.
