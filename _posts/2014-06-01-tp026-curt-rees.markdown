* It is about connections that is most beneficial. 
* Connecting with [Bill Ferriter](https://twitter.com/plugusin) and [John Pederson](https://twitter.com/ijohnpederson)

* Remodeling his school thanks to a funding referendum his community. 
* Student-produced newscast. (Led by [Crystal Brunelle](https://twitter.com/librarygrl2))
* His school's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NorthernHillsElementary)
* Going out in the school and snapping pictures. 
* [International Happy Day](http://curtrees.com/2014/03/20/happy-day-at-northern-hills/) "Wouldn't this be cool to do?" - said a teacher at his school. 
* [People make stuff up on the Internet](http://curtrees.com/2013/12/24/people-make-stuff-up-on-the-internet-other-people-believe-it/)
* Humility - Curt is constantly deferring praise to others and deflecting praise and comments to his staff and other people around him.
* [Strengths-Based Leadership](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595620257/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595620257&linkCode=as2&tag=jethrojonesco-20&linkId=27QBLZJP2K62AVBR) Great book! 
* Great leaders need to be excellent listeners.
* How Curt grew to learn about himself. Evaluating others. 
* Giving feedback that is based on what is seen in other classrooms, rather than, "When I was a teacher..."
* We have to notice others around us. 
* Spend time to get to know people. Make sure you're winning hearts and minds before you try to do anything. 
* We aren't a bunch of independent contractor. 
* [Techlandia podcast](http://techlandia.podomatic.com). And on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TechlandiaCast) - If you listen to this on Sunday, you'll find something that you can put to use on Monday.
* How to be a Transformative Principal: Be well read. 
* What motivates him: Nice notes from teachers, parents, students.
* "You are responsible for the energy you bring into this space."
