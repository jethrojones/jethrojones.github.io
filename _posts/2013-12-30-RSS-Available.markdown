I finally got the RSS feed working tonight. That is pretty exciting for me, because I have no idea what I am doing. 

I used [this site](https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds) to figure it out. I think I got it from [the Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/).

But, I think I can [figure this new hard thing out.](

If this worked, there is sweet picture on this post. Again, I can do this! 

Here is the RSS Feed: http://jethrojones.com/feed.xml

One day, I will figure out how to have a link to the RSS feed. Slow and steady.
