Today, I have the pleasure of introducing you to Alice Peck, one of the best principals I have ever worked with. You'll love to get to know her in this episode. 

* How she came to be where she is at. 
* What she noticed coming from Texas to Utah. 
* What she really enjoys about how things have changed since she came to her current position. 
* How she got her staff on board right from the beginning with PBIS. 
* The art program at Oakdale.
* The process of starting PBIS at her school. Practical advice of how to get things going. 
* How important it is to have the whole staff involved in school-wide initiatives (speaking of PBIS specifically). 
* Why an actual form for Office Discipline Referral form is important. 
* Where to go when processes are established and ready to maintain.
