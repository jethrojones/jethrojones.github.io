I am hosting this blog on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) and I am learning a lot about ruby, web development, git, commits, pulls, and more. There is still a lot I don't know, but it is fun to learn about it. 

Today, my page build failed for some reason, I think because I was using [prose.io](http://prose.io) (a web site designed to edit GitHub Pages instead of reserving a Jekyll server and committing the changes). I broke my web site, and I didn't know what I did.

So, I just opened my GitHub manager (is that what it is called?) and reverted to the previous working version. It was pretty awesome that it worked. I made the changes I had been trying to make and it worked. Wahoo!

Have a Good Life.
