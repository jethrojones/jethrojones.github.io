<div class="post">
<p>I am hosting this blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and I am learning a lot about ruby, web development, git, commits, pulls, and more. There is still a lot I don&#39;t know, but it is fun to learn about it. </p>

<p>Today, my page build failed for some reason, I think because I was using <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> (a web site designed to edit GitHub Pages instead of reserving a Jekyll server and committing the changes). I broke my web site, and I didn&#39;t know what I did. </p>

<p>So, I just opened my GitHub manager (is that what it is called?) and reverted to the previous working version. It was pretty awesome that it worked. I made the changes I had been trying to make and it worked. Wahoo!</p>

<p>Have a Good Life.</p>
