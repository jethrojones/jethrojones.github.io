<p>Sandra is a great principal at Sandy Elementary. She has received numerous awards in her 7 years as an administrator: </p>

<p>-Community Leader of the Year
-Rookie of the Year
-Distinguished Principal of the Year
-CITES Recognition
-National Board Certified Teacher</p>

<p>And, she is pretty much always being praised and recognized by her peers. I am fortunate to be able to work with her. </p>

<p><a href="http://sandy.canyonsdistrict.org">Here is Sandy&#39;s web site</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyElementary">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Big Goals:
Wants to make people feel like they are at home-that her school is a family. 
Wants to be with the children as much as possible. 
Wants to provide a holistic education, especially to her disadvantaged students.</p>

<p>It is interesting to hear that she strives to really know her students, but is ok with not knowing every student&#39;s name. I find this fascinating. In the last episode, Dr. Villar was very focused on knowing every student&#39;s name. I don&#39;t know that either way is the best method, but I do believe that their intent is the same. They both want their students to know that they are cared for and feel safe. That is what matters.</p>

<p>What is in her office?</p>

<p>What can you do to be a transformative principal? </p>
