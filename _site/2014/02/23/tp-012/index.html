<p>I’m really excited about this interview with Eric Sheninger <a href="http://twitter.com/NMHS_Principal">@NMHS_Principal</a>. </p>

<p>Eric goes over the 7 pillars of Digital Leadership in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1452276617/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1452276617&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jethrojonesco-20">his new book</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Public Relations</li>
<li>Branding </li>
<li>Student Engagement/Learning</li>
<li>Professional Growth/Development</li>
<li>Reenvisioning Learning Spaces and Environments</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
</ul>

<p>Eric talks about how his school&#39;s journey and how that can be a template for changing from a mandate-driven school to one of empowerment. </p>

<p>Our conversation includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How social media has changed and pushed his view of the world.</li>
<li>What we don&#39;t know we fear. </li>
<li>Why it is important to give students a voice. </li>
<li>How to get students to be the focus on the essential skill sets.</li>
<li>How to make learning for students applicable to their (and our) real lives.</li>
<li>How to change midstream from one way to do things to how he does them now. </li>
<li>We need to be the lead learners. </li>
<li>How to get all teachers on board with a vision (hint: it is all about mindset).</li>
<li>How he gives his teachers autonomy in what they are doing in their classrooms. </li>
<li>How making learning fun contributes to higher scores, graduation rates, and college graduation rates.</li>
<li>What you can do to be a transformative principal today. Get on Social Media and don&#39;t reinvent the wheel. </li>
<li>What motivates and inspires him. His students. He has pictures on his walls in his office that help him focus on what is most important. </li>
</ul>

<p>Eric talks about how he pulled 5 teachers aside in 2009 to instill his vision in their minds. He joined Twitter in March 2009, and so he really did have a change of heart. He shows that when he learns something new, he knows that it is important to implement it and change his life. </p>

<p>Have a Good Life.</p>
