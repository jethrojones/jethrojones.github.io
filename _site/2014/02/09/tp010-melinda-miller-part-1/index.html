<div class="post">
<p>In this episode I have the great opportunity to interview <a href="https://twitter.com/mmiller7571">Melinda Miller (@mmiller7571)</a>. I have followed her for a long time on Twitter, and I loved the podcast she did with <a href="https://twitter.com/scottelias">@ScottElias</a> called Practical Principals. That great podcast partly inspired me to start this podcast. I still haven&#39;t found a podcast that talks about the real issues that are facing to </p>

<p>Our conversation covers these topics: </p>

<ol>
<li>How she gets teachers on board with technology. </li>
<li>How she allows teachers to filter out what she says and when. </li>
<li>She gives her thoughts on requirements for teacher&#39;s blogs, which are a requirement for her. </li>
<li>How Melinda deals with the roadblocks of implementing new things (including technology).</li>
<li>How she knows how hard to push her teachers, and what to focus on when she is pushing her teachers. </li>
<li>How she allows her faculty to talk to her about when she is pushing too hard. </li>
<li>How she implemented <a href="http://weprincipal.blogspot.com/2014/01/uncensored-11-4th-grade-chromebook.html">1:1 Chromebooks in 4th grade</a> when a bunch of other stuff was coming down the pike.<br></li>
<li>How she prepares for the beginning of a new school year. (And <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/jan14/vol56/num01/Flipped-Faculty-Meeting-Videos.aspx">here is the ASCD article on her flipped faculty meeting</a>.) Keep your flipped faculty meetings short, to the point, and give teachers plenty of time to look at the information. </li>
<li>Most important tip for starting flipped faculty meetings. </li>
<li>How important it is to have video or audio to help people not misunderstand what they are doing wrong. </li>
</ol>
