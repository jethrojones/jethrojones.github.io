          <h2>Middle School Schedule</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>When I was in the EBL Department, the other specialists and I spent months working on a middle school schedule to prepare for the reconfiguration when 6th grade would move into the middle school and 9th grade would move into the high school. Leslie Allen and I worked hard with School Performance Director Mike Sirois to create a schedule that would allow built-in time for students to have remediation and enrichment in ELA and Math courses. </p>

<p>As you can see under the heading of &quot;Students Achieve Under New Middle School Schedule&quot; in <a href="http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2744%3Aboard-meeting-tuesday-feb-4-2014&amp;Itemid=630&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BoardMeetingSummary+%28Board+Meeting+Summaries%29">these board meeting minutes</a>, &quot;Middle school reading scores have skyrocketed this fall, following an emphasis on reading and interdisciplinary teaming in the <a href="http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1687&amp;Itemid=804">new middle school model</a>&quot;. </p>

<p>It is really awesome to see the model that I had a hand in creating come to fruition AND see that model produce great results for the students in our district. I certainly wasn&#39;t the only one working on it, but I remember &quot;building the board&quot; in bed late into the night with fake teachers; what an awesome learning experience for me. </p>

<p>This experience also represents a time when I was intensely focused on building and implementing a big vision that would affect hundreds of students. </p>

<p>Leslie, Mike, and I had all worked to create this sort of schedule when Leslie and I were teachers for Mike at Fort Herriman Middle School. I am humbled that the work we started as enthusiastic teachers is now a model that all middle schools in our district embrace and that &quot;the model is garnering attention statewide.&quot;</p>

<p>I really love the idea that in education, we can make innovative strides that lead to success for our students. </p>

<p>Have a Good Life.</p>
