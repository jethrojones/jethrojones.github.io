<p>In this second part of the interview, I am priveleged to talk with Doug Hallenbeck. Doug was recently named the <a href="http://www.canyonsdistrict.org/index.php?Itemid=1&amp;id=2699%3Aunion-assistant-principal-named-utahs-best&amp;option=com_k2&amp;view=item">Assistant Principal of the year from the Utah Association of Secondary School Principals</a>. Doug has worked under four really great principals and he shares some great insight about how to be an amazing assistant principal.</p>

<p>I wanted to interview Doug because he has a great story. He is a thoughtful, caring, and transformative leader. He has been a guiding force in our district since its inception. We are very fortunate to work with him. </p>

<p>In this second part of the interview, Doug discusses:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to attract and retain great talent.</li>
<li>A nice little side discussion about general trends in teaching hiring. </li>
<li>His advice for an assistant principal to be a transformative assistant principal like him. </li>
<li>What special thing he has in his office. </li>
<li>His experience discussing education with Chinese educational leaders.</li>
<li>How he makes parents feel good when their kids get in trouble. </li>
<li>What he suggests APs should do to be transformative Assistant Principals.</li>
</ul>
