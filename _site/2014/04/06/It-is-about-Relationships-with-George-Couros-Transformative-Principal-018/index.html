<p>I had the great pleasure to attend (and <a href="http://jethrojones.com/ucet2014">present</a>) the UCET (Utah Coalition for Educational Technology) Conference this last Thursday and Friday. While it was a lot of fun, it was also ver powerful and transformative for me. I solidified some educational philosophies and had some time to actually think about what I am doing every day and how I am inspiring (or not) my teachers. George&#39;s keynote was very inspiring, but it was also practical, and I love practical presentations. I loved meeting George after following him for so long. This was a great interview.   </p>

<p>One thing that was really awesome was that he made me wait a few extra minutes to ensure that he had gone through and read every single tweet about his keynote, and replied to those that he felt needed a response. it was amazing to hear him say three or four times, &quot;Just a minute, I need to get through all these tweets. There were a ton of tweets!&quot;Â </p>

<ul>
<li>His keynote called &quot;Innovate! Create! Voice!&quot; and what he was trying to communicate with that. </li>
<li>The importance of creating and sharing with others. </li>
<li>How he encourages teachers and principals to create and share. </li>
<li>What the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture">remix culture</a> is about. </li>
<li>Why it is important to focus on what is really helping kids. </li>
<li>What it means to be a school teacher. </li>
<li>If you don&#39;t know what a hashtag and twitter are, you are illiterate. Why does George believe this? </li>
<li>How you can leverage your network to make things happen. </li>
<li>Why Twitter is about learning and sharing.</li>
<li>How do we do things when our leaders aren&#39;t on board, yet?</li>
<li>We need people who are willing to push. </li>
<li>The one thing you can do to be a transformative principal.</li>
<li><a href="http://connectedprincipals.com">Connected Principals</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cpchat">#cpchat</a>) and how to get in touch with him (follow him on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/gcouros">@gcourous</a>)</li>
</ul>
