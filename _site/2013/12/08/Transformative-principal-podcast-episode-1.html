<p><a href="http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/interview-with-sondra-jolovich-motes">This interview</a> with Sandra Jolovich-Motes (JM) is really fantastic.  This is part one of <a href="http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/transformative-principal-002-interview-with-sondra-jolovich-motes-part-2">two</a>. </p>

<p>JM is making huge gains in her standardized test scores by focusing on data. She is an advocate of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Paul_bambrick">Paul Bambrick-Santoya&#39;s</a> approach and recommends all principals take advantage of his books and resources. </p>

<p>Have a good life. </p>
