That great podcast partly inspired me to start this podcast. I still haven't found a podcast that talks about the real issues that are facing to 

Our conversation covers these topics:

1. Positive intentions - how she approaches teachers who need to be corrected. 
1. Turnover and how she gets great people to come to her school.

1. How she uses [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/mmiller7571/) to help her teachers.

1. Jethro's [Twitter failure when he was a teacher](http://mrjonesed.blogspot.com/2008/04/twitter-backfires.html).

1. What is something in her office that is meaningful to you? 



She has a lot of great information on her [blog](http://weprincipal.blogspot.com). If you read blogs by principals and you aren't reading hers, you are missing out. 


Have a Good Life.
